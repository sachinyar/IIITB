--Task 0: Store data on S3
--1.Create a bucket in S3 and upload the data in the bucket.
--Bucket created at 's3://ankur-milano/' and data uploaded

--2.Once the cluster is running, open the Hue notebook.

--Task 1: Understand the data in hand
--1.The dataset is of size ~6MB, which should not be deleted. Hence import the entire data in an external table.
--2.The data has a lot of empty cells. Import it such that the empty cells are treated as NULL in Hive.

--Task 2: Writing Hive Queries - I
-- You are working as an analyst responsible for analysing telecom data of three countries (country_code = 39, 43, 33).

--For this task, first compress the table that was created in the beginning of task 2.

--Submit the result upto three decimal places, without rounding off the digits. You may either compress the partitioned table or not.
